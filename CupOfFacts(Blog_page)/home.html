        <p class="whats_coffee">Coffee is a beverage prepared from roasted coffee beans.The roasted and ground seeds of the tropical evergreen coffee plant are used to make coffee. Among the top three drinks consumed worldwide, coffee is also one of the most lucrative commodities traded internationally.Although coffee is the base for a plethora of drinks, such as lattes, espresso, cappuccinos, and mochas, its appeal is mostly due to the stimulating impact that caffeine, an alkaloid found in coffee, produces.</p>

        <h1 class="whats" id="What_is_coffee?">What is Coffee?</h1>
        <p class="whats_coffee">Coffee is a beverage brewed from roasted or unroasted coffee beans.The beans are found inside the fruit (commonly known as cherries) of the Coffea plant. There are many varieties of coffee beans, each with unique flavors, aromas, and characteristics. </p>
        <h1 class="whats" id="conditions">Conditons to grow coffee beans</h1>
        <p class="whats_coffee">Growing a coffee plant requires specific environmental conditions to ensure healthy growth and optimal bean production. The main factors that influence coffee cultivation are climate, soil, altitude, water, and shade.<br><br> Here’s a detailed look at the conditions needed to grow coffee:</p>
        <ol class="whats_coffee">
            <li id="h2">
                <p id="h2">Climate</p>
                <ul  class="whats_coffee">
                    <li><span id="side_head">Temperature</span>: Coffee plants thrive in temperatures between 15°C and 24°C. Temperatures that are too high above 30°C or below 10°C can stress the plant, affecting growth and bean quality.</li>
                    <li><span id="side_head">Rainfall</span>: Coffee plants need a good amount of rainfall, typically between 40 to 100 inches annually</li>
                    <li><span id="side_head">Humidity</span>: Moderate to high humidity levels are ideal, especially for Arabica coffee, which requires a more stable and moderate climate compared to Robusta.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li id="h2">
                <p id="h2">Soil</p>
                <ul class="whats_coffee">
                <li><span id="side_head">Type</span>: Coffee plants prefer well-drained, fertile soils rich in organic matter. Loamy soils with good aeration are ideal. Volcanic soils are particularly well-suited for coffee due to their high mineral content.</li>
                <li><span id="side_head">pH Level</span>: A slightly acidic to neutral pH level of 6 to 6.5 is optimal for coffee growth. Extremely acidic or alkaline soils can hinder nutrient absorption.</li>
                <li><span id="side_head">Drainage</span>: Good drainage is crucial as coffee plants are sensitive to waterlogged conditions. Poor drainage can lead to root rot and other diseases.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li id="h2">
                <p id="h2"> Altitude</p>
                <ul class="whats_coffee">
                    <li><span id="side_head">Optimal Range</span>: The ideal altitude for coffee cultivation varies by species. Arabica coffee grows best at higher elevations, typically between 600 to 1,800 meters above sea level. Robusta coffee can grow at lower elevations, from sea level to about 600 meters.</li>
                    <li><span id="side_head">Impact on Flavor</span>: Higher altitudes are generally preferred for Arabica coffee because the cooler temperatures slow down the growth of the coffee cherries, resulting in denser beans with more complex flavors and acidity.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li id="h2">
                <p id="h2">Water</p>
                <ul class="whats_coffee">
                    <li><span id="side_head">Irrigation</span>: While coffee plants need a steady supply of water, they should not be overwatered. Adequate irrigation during dry periods is essential, especially in regions with irregular rainfall.</li>
                    <li><span id="side_head">Water Quality</span>: The quality of water used for irrigation is also important. Clean, fresh water without high levels of salinity or contaminants is ideal for coffee plant health.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li id="h2">
                <p id="h2">Shade</p>
                <ul class="whats_coffee">
                    <li><span id="side_head">Shade-Grown Coffee</span>: Coffee plants, benefit from being grown under a canopy of shade trees. Protecting them from direct sunlight and reducing temperature extremes.</li>
                    <li><span id="side_head">Benefits</span>:Shade helps maintain soil moisture and protects plants from pests and diseases. It also improves coffee quality by allowing the beans to mature more slowly, enhancing their flavor.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li id="h2">
                <p id="h2">Wind Protection</p>
                <ul class="whats_coffee">
                    <li><span id="side_head">Shelter</span>: Coffee plants are susceptible to damage from strong winds, which can cause physical damage to the plants and reduce yield. </li>
                    <li>Windbreaks, such as rows of trees or shrubs, are often planted around coffee plantations to protect the plants from strong winds.</li>

                <ul class="whats_coffee">
                <li><span id="side_head">Management</span>: Coffee plants are susceptible to a variety of pests and diseases, such as coffee leaf rust, coffee berry disease, and the coffee borer beetle. </li>
                <li>Effective pest management strategies, including regular monitoring, organic and chemical treatments, and resistant plant varieties, are essential for healthy coffee cultivation.</li>

        <p class="whats" id="Types">Types of Coffee beans</p>
        <p class="whats_coffee">Coffee beans come from the seeds of coffee cherries produced by the Coffea plant. There are several types of coffee beans,but most commonly use are four(Arabica,Robusta,Liberica and Excelsa).Each type has distinct characteristics that affect the flavor, aroma, and strength of the coffee. <br><br>Here’s an overview of each type:</p>
        <ol>
            <li id="h2">
                <p>Arabica (Coffea arabica):</p>
                <ul>
                    <li class="whats_coffee"><span id="side_head">Origin</span>: Native to Ethiopia, Arabica is the most popular coffee bean, accounting for about 60-70% of the world’s coffee production.</li>
                    <li class="whats_coffee"><span id="side_head">Flavor Profile</span>: Arabica beans are known for their smooth, mild, and aromatic flavor. They tend to have a wide range of tastes depending on where they are grown, often including notes of fruit, sugar, and higher acidity.</li>
                    <li class="whats_coffee"><span id="side_head">Caffeine Content</span>: Generally lower in caffeine compared to Robusta beans.</li>
                    <li class="whats_coffee"><span id="side_head">Growing Conditions</span>: Arabica plants are delicate and prefer higher elevations, between 600-2,000 meters above sea level. They require a cooler climate and are more susceptible to pests and diseases.</li>
                    <li class="whats_coffee"><span id="side_head">Bean Shape</span>: Arabica beans are typically oval-shaped with a curved crease.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <br>

                <li class="whats_coffee"><span id="side_head">Flavor Profile</span>: Robusta beans have a strong, harsh, and more bitter flavor compared to Arabica. They often have a nutty or woody aftertaste and are less sweet and aromatic.</li>
                <li class="whats_coffee"><span id="side_head">Caffeine Content</span>: Higher in caffeine than Arabica, which contributes to its more bitter taste and increased pest resistance.</li>
                <li class="whats_coffee"><span id="side_head">Growing Conditions</span>: Robusta plants are hardier and can grow at lower elevations, from sea level to 600 meters. They are more resistant to pests and diseases and can thrive in hotter climates.</li>
                <li class="whats_coffee"><span id="side_head">Bean Shape</span>: Robusta beans are rounder and smaller, with a straight crease.</li>
